# Synckai

**Continuous synchronization of a local folder to an Amazon S3 bucket.**

## Description

Synckai is a command-line tool that enables continuous synchronization of a local folder with an Amazon S3 bucket. It monitors changes in the local folder and automatically uploads new or modified files to the specified S3 bucket.

## Installation

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nifetency/Synckai.git
```

### Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Synckai
```

## Usage

### Running the Docker Container

To run Synckai using Docker, build the Docker image and run it with the required arguments.

### Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t synckai .
```

### Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run --rm synckai <localFolderPath> <s3BucketName>
```

Replace \`<localFolderPath>\` with the path to the local folder you want to sync, and \`<s3BucketName>\` with the name of the Amazon S3 bucket.

### Configuration

Synckai supports configuration through environment variables. You can set the following environment variables to configure the application:

- \`LOCAL_FOLDER_PATH\`: Path to the local folder to sync.
- \`S3_BUCKET_NAME\`: Name of the Amazon S3 bucket.
- \`CONTINUOUS_SYNC\`: Set to \`true\` to enable continuous sync.

Alternatively, you can create a \`.env\` file in the project root directory with the following content:

```bash
LOCAL_FOLDER_PATH=/path/to/local/folder
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket-name
CONTINUOUS_SYNC=true
```

## GitHub Actions

You can automate the building and pushing of your Docker image using GitHub Actions. Hereâ€™s an example workflow that builds the Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub:

### \`.github/workflows/docker-image.yml\`

```bash
name: Docker Image CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

    - name: Log in to Docker Hub
      uses: docker/login-action@v2
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

    - name: Build and push Docker image
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
      with:
        context: .
        tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/synckai:latest
        push: true
```

### GitHub Secrets Setup:

Ensure you add the following secrets in your GitHub repository settings:
